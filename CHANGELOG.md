# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to Droidance are recorded in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and public releases use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Record a notable change in `Unreleased` within the same pull request that implements it. Use only the categories that contain changes: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, and `Security`. Mark incompatible entries with `**Breaking:**`, name the affected contract, and give migration steps. At release time, move the entries under the exact version and its release date. Supply the corresponding Simplified Chinese notes as release input; local authoring records are not part of the public source.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-11-14

- Add Shizuku as a connection option in setup and settings.
- Show Shizuku service and authorization status, with device connection recovery.
- Keep existing device control available when Shizuku stops, while the resident connection remains active.

Install and start Shizuku before connecting, and restart it after rebooting your phone. If Shizuku is started with root, use Droidance's Root connection.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-11-12

Refine multi-step screen actions, list collection, and date/time wheel controls.

Improve waits after page transitions and feedback when actions need recovery.

Allow slower models to begin responding within the request budget, and refresh model lists when opened.

Confirm or decline actions directly in chat.

Fix update checks and clean unused attachments and expired caches while preserving conversation screenshots.

Make running-status text shimmer clearer in light and dark themes.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-11-09

- Prevent background tasks from taking main-screen input focus on Android 14+.
- Return temporary input focus after queries and keep background tasks from switching the system keyboard.
- Add text entry and Enter controls to the virtual-space viewer.
- **Breaking:** Background `method=ime` and keyboard-show actions are disabled. Use `shortcut` or `paste_key`; use the viewer’s text control for manual entry on Android 14+.

Known issue: Text replacement can intermittently retain previous text when editing two windows of the same app.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-11-08

- Fix runtime startup failures that prevented tasks from starting on affected Android devices.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-07

- Back up and restore conversations, screenshots, memory, skills, and settings in a password-encrypted file.
- Export redacted diagnostics, with optional task content.
- Move existing data into app storage during upgrade; uninstalling or clearing data removes app data.
- Fix startup with incompatible rule overrides, default persona updates, and provider list positioning.

**Breaking:** Install over the existing app, then open Droidance and connect the device service to migrate your data. Downgrading to 0.1.x is not supported. Before uninstalling, save a backup outside the app's storage and keep its password safe.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-11-06

- Discover and manage provider models while keeping custom selections.
- Group provider and subscription endpoints, update model presets, and complete provider icons.
- Fix API address selection and wireless pairing notification recovery.
- Improve local-network access, streaming tool calls, and runtime stability.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- Connect a rooted device without wireless debugging, with a shared connection selector in setup and settings.

### Fixed

- Prevent obsolete device-service broadcasts from crashing the app after an update.
- Keep provider and wireless-pairing credentials out of persistent runtime storage and remove old copies for the current installation.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-11-05

### Fixed

- Keep conversations and permission prompts accessible during startup and runtime reconnection.
- Add manual wireless pairing and connection ports, clarify ADB persistence, and detect blocked input permissions.
- Verify Android actions more carefully, read the next alarm, and avoid retrying actions with uncertain effects.
- Prevent virtual-display recovery from waking the physical screen, and restore reference-backed skills and complete diagnostic exports.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Custom rule overrides must add `effect_checkpoint` to `tool_contracts.yaml`, `decision_boundary_operations` to `harness_policy.yaml`, and `intent_extra_contracts` to `device_tools.md`.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-11-04

### Changed

- Keep tasks running more reliably when the app is frozen in the background, with a collapsible on-screen control island.
- Reference skills from the chat menu or @ suggestions, and return to the conversation when a device task finishes.
- Improve Android system actions, including alarms, calendars and result verification.

### Fixed

- Wait for settings-based permissions and resume the same task after authorization.
- Improve task notifications and open Droidance when the virtual screen is empty.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- Add a Back button to the virtual-space control island during manual control and teaching.

### Fixed

- Improve system Back gestures and keyboard focus in virtual space.
- Keep automatic device reconnection quiet unless a connection problem was shown.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-11-02

### Added

- Show chat and conversation token usage; hide counts when unavailable.

### Fixed

- Recover temporary screenshot failures and pause for blocked input permissions.
- Explain task failures more clearly and retain diagnostic references.

### Changed

- Keep documentation, tests and acceptance tools local.
- **Custom rule overrides:** replace `observation_unavailable_diagnostics` with `recovery_handoffs` and refresh bundled notice keys.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-11-02

### Added

- Optional ADB persistence reconnects through a saved local port after network changes. It is disabled by default and requires USB debugging to be enabled manually.

### Fixed

- Sidecar recovery now tries the saved local ADB port without waiting for Wi-Fi.
- Port setup waits until tasks are idle. Pairing details are retained if port shutdown cannot be confirmed.
- Tasks without a configured model now explain how to add a model and API key.
- ADB shell output is decoded correctly for process detection and recovery diagnostics.

### Changed

- GitHub release descriptions are English. In-app update notes use the selected app language, with separate English and Chinese text.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-11-02

### Added

- Every provider can now use Chat Completions or Responses, and the edit page shows the final request URL.

### Changed

- The provider list and chat model list show the default provider first, then custom providers, then presets.
- A 403 from a model service now asks you to check API key permissions or plan, and shows the service's reason with sensitive values removed.
- A task stopped by a rejected API key now says to check the key instead of showing a generic execution error.
- After pairing, device control keeps working without Wi-Fi and on mobile data. Pairing and reconnecting after a phone restart still need Wi-Fi.
- The background control service restarts itself if it is killed or crashes, without Wi-Fi. Resetting pairing stops it, and it does not restart once developer options are off.
- Update notes in the app follow the app language.

### Fixed

- A complete `/responses` address no longer becomes `/responses/responses`.
- After Wi-Fi drops, pairing settings keep showing Connected while the background control service is running, and reading notifications no longer needs the live wireless debugging connection.
- A restarted app can reconnect to the background control service without Wi-Fi while the screen is off.
- The virtual display now recovers when you lock or unlock the phone during a task.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-01

### Added

- Built-in cloud model provider presets. Enter your own API key and model ID to enable a provider, or start from a custom endpoint.

### Changed

- Android 11–13 support is now marked experimental. Low-memory and Android Go devices report that they are unsupported.

### Fixed

- Screen capture, viewer mirroring and takeover failures on Android 11–14, including "screen channel unavailable" on Samsung devices.
- Key and text input on Android 11–13, and foreground detection on vendor system formats.
- A clear message when the system blocks input, with the setting to change.
- Virtual displays created on a foldable's cover screen are rebuilt after unfolding.
- Text input no longer follows focus into another app or system window.
